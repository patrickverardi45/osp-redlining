# TrueLine v2 Session Handoff

**Saved:** 2026-06-12
**Branch:** `feat/truelinev2`
**Pushed engine HEAD:** `972b83449e1bf8ab00def945e5120dc9918f3bd9`
**Verified tests:** `484 passed`

## Guardrails

- Do not merge or deploy.
- Do not touch production `main`.
- Keep all new engine work on `feat/truelinev2`.
- Preserve existing untracked files.

## Shipped State

### M8.15 - reviewer cards and static demo

- The lane-outcome -> reviewer-card bridge is pushed.
- The static reviewer demo sidecar exposes exactly 9 design-stroke cards:
  - 4 `DESIGN_STROKE_REVIEW`
  - 5 `DESIGN_PICK_CARD`
- Stroke cards preserve the lane's evidence-backed geometry and artifact
  references.
- Pick cards remain `SUGGESTION_NOT_PLACEMENT` and carry no stroke geometry
  or image.

### M8.16 - cross-sheet continuation law

- The cross-sheet continuation resolver probe/law is pushed.
- All 16 banked cross-sheet bores were attempted.
- Zero converted to strokes under the current printed evidence.
- This is the banked evidence-backed honest negative: every refusal is typed
  and names the missing relationship.

### M8.17 - segmented far-sheet callout chains

- Segmented far-sheet callout-chain assembly is pushed for `log8` and `log32`.
- Neither bore converted to a stroke.
- Both advanced from `CROSS_SHEET_CONTINUATION_REQUIRED` to
  `STRUCTURE_IDENTITY_BINDING_REQUIRED`.
- Their far-sheet chains are now proven:
  - `log8`: `0+00 -> 1+10 -> 1+76`; `110 + 66 = 176`, plus the `214`-foot
    end segment gives `390` feet total.
  - `log32`: `0+00 -> 1+30 -> 1+77`; `130 + 47 = 177`, plus the `36`-foot
    end segment gives `213` feet total.
- The remaining blocker shared by `log8`, `log32`, and `log42` is
  start-structure identity / per-ladder tick clustering.

### M8.18 - proof-only ladder discriminator seam

- M8.18 is pushed at engine HEAD `b7410a5`.
- Added the proof-only ladder discriminator seam:
  - `truelinev2/extract/ladder_cluster.py`
  - `truelinev2/proof/run_ladder_discriminator_probe.py`
  - `truelinev2/tests/test_ladder_cluster.py`
- The seam is not wired into a placement lane. No strokes were placed.
  No lane wiring was added.
- The all-58 sweep census is unchanged: `13 cross-sheet / 3 structure-required`.
  There is no census change or accepted-log drift.
- `log42` has 0 traceable survivors.
- `log8` and `log32` narrow to the same port HH `NEXTLINK@378,409`, creating a
  cross-bore collision.
- The banked b.9 join refuses `log8` and `log32` on implied-scale because their
  curved end-sheet routes fail the 5% gate.
- The blocker has shifted from start identity to cross-sheet join geometry.

### M8.19 - path-length cross-sheet join Phase 0/1

- M8.19 is pushed at engine HEAD `972b834`.
- Added the proof-only path-length cross-sheet join probe:
  - `truelinev2/proof/run_path_length_join_probe.py`
  - `truelinev2/tests/test_path_length_join.py`
- No lane wiring. No strokes placed.
- The all-58 sweep census is unchanged: `13 cross-sheet / 3 structure-required`.
  There is no census change.
- The current b.9 join failure for `log8` and `log32` is caused by
  chord/implied-scale measurement on curved routes.
- Path-length measurement using `walk_design_path` + `path_length`, with
  the unchanged `cross_sheet_join_verdict` and unchanged 5% tolerance, proves:
  - `log8`: `1.508` vs `1.554`
  - `log32`: `1.499` vs `1.441`
  - `log65` remains proven both ways.
- The remaining blocker is adjudication, not geometry:
  - `log8` and `log32` both bind the same port HH `NEXTLINK@378,409`.
  - The owner must decide/confirm whether this is a valid
    multi-drop/shared-origin terminal.
  - If it is not confirmed, the next capability is a per-bore discriminator
    using intermediate chain stations `1+10` vs `1+30`.

## Verification

- Tests: `484 passed`.
- M8.19 path-length cross-sheet join probe G1-G5: PASS.
- M8.18 ladder discriminator probe G1-G6: PASS.
- M8.16/M8.17 continuation probe G1-G7: PASS.
- All-58 sweep G1-G7: PASS; census `25/13/5/5/4/3/1/2 = 58`.
- Design-path adherence: PASS.
- M8.15 cards: PASS.
- M8.10/M8.11: PASS.
- b.9/b.10: PASS.
- Demo artifact: PASS.

## Remaining Blocker Classes

1. Shared-origin adjudication for `log8` and `log32`: both bind
   `NEXTLINK@378,409`. Geometry is proven; owner confirmation is required for
   a valid multi-drop/shared-origin terminal. Otherwise, discriminate by the
   intermediate chain stations `1+10` vs `1+30`.
2. Uniquely traceable design path through the dense network for `log42`.
3. No printed matchline equation:
   `log10`, `log14`, `log61`, `log62`, `log67`, `log68`, `log70`.
   Owner decision required: geo/KMZ corroboration or reviewer pick-cards.
4. Lower-yield printed-evidence gaps:
   `log12`, `log46`, `log60`, `log64`, `log71`, `log72`.

## Recommended Next Lane After Reset

1. Patrick makes the visual/field call on shared `NEXTLINK@378,409`.
2. Then use an Opus follow-up for either safe wiring as REVIEW strokes or the
   per-bore discriminator.
3. No Fable escalation is warranted yet.

## Session Sizing

Fable 5 UltraCode jobs should be split or begin with a 100% token window.
Opus lanes are generally okay, but their scope should still stay tight.

## Current Boundary

No merge, deployment, production-main change, or new engine work is part of
this session save.
